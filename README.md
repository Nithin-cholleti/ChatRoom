# TCP Chat Room

**A real-time multi-user chat application implemented with Python's socket programming and multi-threading capabilities**

## Project Overview
Developed a robust TCP-based chat room application using Python that allows multiple users to connect and communicate in real-time within a local area network. The system implements a client-server architecture with concurrent client handling through multi-threading.

## Technical Implementation
- **Socket Programming**: Utilized Python's socket library to establish TCP connections between clients and server
- **Multi-threading**: Implemented concurrent processing with Python's threading module to handle multiple client connections simultaneously
- **Error Handling**: Built robust error detection and graceful disconnection handling to maintain system stability
- **Event Broadcasting**: Created efficient message distribution system to relay messages to all connected clients
- **User Management**: Implemented nickname registration and tracking for user identification

## Key Features
- Real-time message broadcasting to all connected clients
- User join/leave notifications to all participants
- Nickname-based user identification system
- Concurrent client handling with thread-per-client model
- Graceful error handling and connection management
- Low-latency communication using optimized buffer sizes

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network socket programming
- Concurrent programming with threads
- Client-server architecture design
- Low-level protocol implementation
- System reliability engineering
- Exception handling in distributed systems
